> When Albert Einstein went to Hollywood in 1931 it's said that the only person he wanted to meet was Charlie Chaplin.
Albert Einstein: "What I most admire about your art, is your universality. You don’t say a word, yet the world understands you!"
Charlie Chaplin: "True. But your glory is even greater! The whole world admires you, even though they don’t understand a word of what you say."
