I'm a diabetic, and sugar is my nemesis.
I'm a weak person. I have a disease that, when it is at its worst, makes people die very easily. Lose a foot, go blind, or have a heart attack. Those were just three off the top of my head.

I'll tell you a secret. Eating better and excerise will cure me. Seriously cure me. Moving off the couch and raising my heart rate for 30 minutes and not eating sugar will actually cure my disease.

Yet, I'm not doing it. Go figure.
